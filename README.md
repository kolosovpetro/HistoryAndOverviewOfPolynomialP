## History and overview of the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$

### Abstract

The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a $2m+1$ degree polynomial in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$
defined by an identity for odd-powers.
The odd-power identity is derived applying certain interpolation approaches
including systems of linear equations and recurrence relations.
This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of the polynomial
$\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ continuing with related works based on it.
Notable results inside related works include the relation between ordinary and partial derivatives for odd-powers,
finding the derivative of polynomials via double limit etc.
Finally, the manuscript concludes with future research directions and activities.

### Open research opportunities & other activities

Open research opportunities are described in the section "Future research" of
[current manuscript](https://kolosovpetro.github.io/pdf/HistoryAndOverviewOfPolynomialP.pdf),
still it is worth to duplicate them here

- Differential equation (2.1) can be expressed in terms of backward and central differentials,
  as well as its dynamic equation analogs [19]
- Definition (1.8) is closely related to discrete convolution, probably some new identities
  in terms of discrete convolution may be found
- All kind of derivatives (forward, backward, central), including time scale ones can be
  expressed as double limit similarly to [20]
- Equation (1.8) approximates odd-power $2m+1$ in some neighborhood of fixed point
  a as it shown on graphs
- Validation and fixing grammar issues

Please note that equation and references numbers in README may not match the actual in manuscript,
