# History and overview of the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$

Polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a $2m+1, \; m\in\mathbb{N}$ degree polynomial in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$,
such that derived applying certain methods of interpolation, so that initially we reach the base case for $m=1$
generalizing it up to $m\in\mathbb{N}$ afterwards.
In particular, the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ may be successfully applicable
for polynomial interpolation and approximation approaches.
This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$
as well as related works such that based onto, for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
In addition, future research directions are proposed and discussed.
