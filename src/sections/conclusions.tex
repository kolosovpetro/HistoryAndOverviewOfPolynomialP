In this manuscript we have successfully provided a comprehensive historical survey
of the milestones and evolution of the polynomial $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$
as well as related works such that based onto, for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
In addition, future research directions are proposed and discussed.
