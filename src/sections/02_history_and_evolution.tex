Back then, in 2016 being a student at the faculty of mechanical engineering,
I remember myself playing with finite differences of the polynomial $n^3$ over the domain of natural numbers $n\in\mathbb{N}$
having at most $0 \leq n \leq 20$ values.
Looking to the values in my finite difference tables, the first and very naive question that came to my mind was
\begin{center}
    \textit{Is it possible to re-assemble the value of
    the polynomial $n^3$ backwards having its finite differences?}
\end{center}
The answer to this question is definitely \textit{Yes}, utilizing the interpolation principles.
Interpolation is a process of finding new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points.
Interpolation has been well-developed in between 1674--1684
by Issac Newton's fundamental works, nowadays known as foundation of classical interpolation
theory~\cite{meijering2002chronology}.

At that time, in 2016, I was a first-year mechanical engineering undergraduate,
so that due to lack of knowledge and perspective of view I started re-inventing interpolation
formula myself, fueled by purest passion and feeling of mystery.
All mathematical laws and relations exist from the very beginning, but we only find and describe them, I thought.
That mindset truly inspired me so that my own mathematical journey has been started.
Let us begin considering the table of finite differences of the polynomial $n^3$
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \setlength\extrarowheight{-6pt}
        \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
            $n$ & $n^3$ & $\Delta(n^3)$ & $\Delta^2(n^3)$ & $\Delta^3(n^3)$ \\
            \hline
            0   & 0     & 1             & 6               & 6               \\
            1   & 1     & 7             & 12              & 6               \\
            2   & 8     & 19            & 18              & 6               \\
            3   & 27    & 37            & 24              & 6               \\
            4   & 64    & 61            & 30              & 6               \\
            5   & 125   & 91            & 36              &                 \\
            6   & 216   & 127           &                 &                 \\
            7   & 343   &               &                 &
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Table of finite differences of the polynomial $n^3$.} \label{tab:table}
\end{table}
First and foremost, we can observe that finite difference $\Delta(n^3)$ of the polynomial $n^3$
can be expressed through summation over $n$, e.g
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cubes_interpolation}
    \begin{split}
        \Delta(0^3) &= 1+6 \cdot 0 \\
        \Delta(1^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1 \\
        \Delta(2^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2 \\
        \Delta(3^3) &= 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3 \\
        &\; \; \vdots
    \end{split}
\end{align}
Finally reaching its generic form
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(n^3) = 1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+6\cdot3+\cdots+6\cdot n = 1 + 6 \sum_{k=0}^{n} k\label{eq:general-cube-eq}
\end{equation}
The one experienced mathematician would immediately notice a spot to apply Faulhaber's formula~\cite{beardon1996sums}
to expand the term $\sum_{k=0}^{n} k$ reaching expected result that matches Binomial theorem~\cite{abramowitz1988handbook},
so that
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = \frac{1}{2}(n+n^2)
\end{equation*}
Then our relation~\eqref{eq:general-cube-eq} immediately turns into Binomial expansion
\begin{equation}
    \Delta(n^3) = (n+1)^3 - n^3 = 1 + 6 \left[ \frac{1}{2}(n+n^2) \right] = 1 + 3 n + 3 n^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{2} \binom{3}{k} n^k
    \label{eq:cubes-difference-binomial-theorem}
\end{equation}
However, as was said, I was not the experienced one mathematician back then,
so that I reviewed the relation~\eqref{eq:general-cube-eq} from a little bit different perspective.
Not following the convenient solution~\eqref{eq:cubes-difference-binomial-theorem},
I have rearranged the first order finite differences from the table~\eqref{tab:table} using~\eqref{eq:cubes_interpolation}
to get the polynomial $n^3$
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rearrangement_to_get_cubes}
    n^3 &= [1+6\cdot0]+[1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1]+[1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2]+\cdots \nonumber \\
    &+[1+6\cdot0+6\cdot1+6\cdot2+\cdots+6\cdot(n-1)]
\end{align}
Then, rearranging the terms of the equation~\eqref{eq:rearrangement_to_get_cubes} so that it turns into summation
in terms of $k (n-k)$
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        n^3 &= n + [(n-0) \cdot 6 \cdot 0] + [(n-1)\cdot6\cdot1] + [(n-2)\cdot6\cdot2] + \cdots \\
        &\cdots + [(n-k)\cdot 6 \cdot k] + \cdots + [1\cdot6\cdot(n-1)]
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Gives the interpolation of the polynomial $n^3$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cube_identity}
    n^3 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 6k(n-k) + 1
\end{equation}
It is immediately seen that~\eqref{eq:cube_identity} is true by observing the table of $6k(n-k) + 1$ values
\begin{table}[H]
    \setlength\extrarowheight{-6pt}
    \begin{tabular}{c|cccccccc}
        $n/k$ & 0 & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4  & 5  & 6  & 7 \\
        \hline
        0     & 1 &    &    &    &    &    &    &   \\
        1     & 1 & 1  &    &    &    &    &    &   \\
        2     & 1 & 7  & 1  &    &    &    &    &   \\
        3     & 1 & 13 & 13 & 1  &    &    &    &   \\
        4     & 1 & 19 & 25 & 19 & 1  &    &    &   \\
        5     & 1 & 25 & 37 & 37 & 25 & 1  &    &   \\
        6     & 1 & 31 & 49 & 55 & 49 & 31 & 1  &   \\
        7     & 1 & 37 & 61 & 73 & 73 & 61 & 37 & 1
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Values of $6k(n-k) + 1$.
    See the OEIS entry: \href{https://oeis.org/A287326}{\texttt{A287326}}~\cite{kolosov2017third}.
    Sequences such that row sums give the polynomials $n^{5}$ and $n^7$
        are also registered in OEIS~\cite{kolosov2018fifth, kolosov2018seventh}.}
    \label{tab:fig_1}
\end{table}
Therefore, we have reached our base case by successfully interpolating the polynomial $n^3$.
Fairly enough that the next curiosity would be
\begin{center}
    \textit{Well, if the relation~\eqref{eq:cube_identity} true for the polynomial $n^3$,
        then is it true that~\eqref{eq:cube_identity} can be generalized for higher powers, e.g. for $n^4$ or $n^5$ either?}
\end{center}
That was my next question, however without any expectation of the final form of generalized relation.

Finally, we got our road to definition of $2m+1$-degree polynomial $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$.
Introducing the parameter $b$ to the upper summation bound of the equation~\eqref{eq:odd-power-theorem},
we have the definition
\begin{defn} (Polynomial $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x} $of degree $2m+1$.)
    \begin{equation}
        \polynomialP{m}{b}{x} = \sum_{k=0}^{b-1} \sum_{r=0}^{m} \coeffA{m}{r} k^r(x-k)^r
        \label{eq:definition_polynomial_p}
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}
where $\coeffA{m}{r}$ are real coefficients~\eqref{eq:definition_coefficient_a}.
A comprehensive discussion on the polynomial $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ as well as its properties can be found at~\cite{kolosov2016link}.
In 2023, Albert Tkaczyk yet again extended the theorem~\eqref{eq:odd-power-theorem} to the so-called three dimension case
so that it gives polynomials of the form $n^{3l+2}$ at~\cite{albert_tkaczyk_2023_8371454}.
For example,
\begin{align*}
    \polynomialP{0}{b}{x}
    &=b, \\
    \polynomialP{1}{b}{x}
    &=3 b^2 - 2 b^3 - 3 b x + 3 b^2 x, \\
    \polynomialP{2}{b}{x}
    &=10 b^3 - 15 b^4 + 6 b^5 \\
    &- 15 b^2 x + 30 b^3 x - 15 b^4 x \\
    &+ 5 b x^2 - 15 b^2 x^2 + 10 b^3 x^2 \\
    \polynomialP{3}{b}{x}
    &=-7 b^2 + 28 b^3 - 70 b^5 + 70 b^6 - 20 b^7 \\
    &+ 7 b x - 42 b^2 x + 175 b^4 x - 210 b^5 x + 70 b^6 x \\
    &+ 14 b x^2 - 140 b^3 x^2 + 210 b^4 x^2 - 84 b^5 x^2 \\
    &+ 35 b^2 x^3 - 70 b^3 x^3 + 35 b^4 x^3
\end{align*}
