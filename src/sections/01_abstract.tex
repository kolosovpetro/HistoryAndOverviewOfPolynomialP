The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $2m+1$ in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$,
defined by an identity for odd powers.
The odd-power identity is derived by applying certain interpolation approaches,
including systems of linear equations and recurrence relations.
This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey
of the milestones and evolution of the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$,
followed by related works based on it.
Notable results in related works include the relation between ordinary and partial derivatives for odd powers,
finding polynomial derivatives via a double limit, etc.
Finally, the manuscript concludes with future research directions and activities.
