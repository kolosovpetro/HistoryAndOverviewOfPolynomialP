This manuscript gives a comprehensive history survey and evolution of work done over the topics of
polynomials $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ such that are polynomials in $(x,b)\in\mathbb{R}, \; m\in\mathbb{N}$.
Motivation of this manuscript is to mitigate degree of chaos in that topic, need to provide clear unambitious explanation
and context as a whole.
We start our journey from the very beginning, e.g interpolation approach to reach the definition of $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$
continuing further with results based on $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$, for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
Also, this manuscript provides further research directions connected with the polynomials $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$.
