The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $2m+1$ in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$,
defined by an identity for odd powers, closely linked to Binomial theorem and Faulhaber's formula.
The odd-power identity is derived using certain interpolation techniques,
including systems of linear equations, recurrence relations, and finite differences.
This manuscript offers a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution
of the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$, followed by related works based on it.
Notable results in related works include the relation between ordinary and partial derivatives
for odd powers and finding polynomial derivatives via a double limit.
Finally, the manuscript proposes future research directions.
