The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a $2m+1$ degree polynomial in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$.
The definition of $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is given by a certain polynomial identity for odd-powers $x^{2m+1}$.
%such that derived applying certain methods of interpolation, so that initially we reach the base case for $m=1$
%generalizing it up to $m\in\mathbb{N}$ afterward.
%In particular, the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ may be successfully applicable
%for polynomial interpolation and approximation approaches.
%This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$
%as well as related works such that based onto, for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
%In addition, future research directions are proposed and discussed.
