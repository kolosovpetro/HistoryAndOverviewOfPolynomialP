%This manuscript gives a comprehensive history survey and evolution of work done over the topics of
%polynomials $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ such that are polynomials in $(x,b)\in\mathbb{R}, \; m\in\mathbb{N}$.
%Motivation of this manuscript is to mitigate degree of chaos (what do you mean by chaos?) in that topic (what topic?),
%need to provide clear unambitious explanation (explanation of what?) and context as a whole.
%We start our journey from the very beginning, e.g interpolation (interpolation of what?) approach to
%reach the definition of $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$
%continuing further with results based on $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$,
%for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
%Also, this manuscript provides further research directions connected with the polynomials $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$.
%(Why these polynomials are of interest at all?)
Polynomial $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ is a $2m+1, \; m\in\mathbb{N}$ degree polynomial in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$,
such that derived applying certain methods of interpolation, so that initially we reach the base case for $m=1$
generalizing it up to $m\in\mathbb{N}$ afterwards.
In particular, the polynomial $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$ may be successfully applicable
for polynomial interpolation and approximation approaches.
This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of $\polynomialP{m}{b}{x}$
as well as related works such that based onto, for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
In addition, future research directions are proposed and discussed.
