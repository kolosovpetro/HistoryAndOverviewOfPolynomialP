The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a $2m+1$ degree polynomial in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$
defined by a polynomial identity for odd-powers such that derived applying certain interpolation approaches.
This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of the polynomial

%In particular, the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ establishes a relation between
%ordinary and partial derivatives of odd-powers.
%Also, it gives an opportunity to express odd-power identity in terms of multiplication of certain matrices.

%such that derived applying certain methods of interpolation, so that initially we reach the base case for $m=1$
%generalizing it up to $m\in\mathbb{N}$ afterward.
%In particular, the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ may be successfully applicable
%for polynomial interpolation and approximation approaches.
%This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$
%as well as related works such that based onto, for instance various polynomial identities, differential equations etc.
%In addition, future research directions are proposed and discussed.
