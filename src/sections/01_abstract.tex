The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a $2m+1$ degree polynomial in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$
defined by an identity for odd-powers such that derived applying certain interpolation approaches.
This manuscript provides a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution of the polynomial
$\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$, continuing with related works based on it.
Notable results inside related works include the relation between ordinary and partial derivatives for odd-powers,
finding the derivative of polynomials via double limit.
Finally, the manuscript concludes with future research directions and activities.
