The polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $2m+1$ in $(x,b) \in \mathbb{R}$,
defined by an identity for odd powers, closely linked to Binomial theorem and Faulhaber's formula.

The odd-power identity is derived using certain interpolation techniques,
including systems of linear equations, recurrence formulas, and finite differences.
This manuscript offers a comprehensive historical survey of the milestones and evolution
of the polynomial $\mathbf{P}^m_b(x)$, followed by related works based on it.

Notable results in related works include the relation between ordinary and partial derivatives
for odd powers, finding polynomial derivatives via a double limit, power function approximations,
connection between discrete convolution of power function, dynamic equations on times scales, etc.

Finally, the manuscript proposes future research directions,
along with Mathematica programs to validate intermediate results.
